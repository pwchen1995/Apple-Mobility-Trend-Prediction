# Apple-Mobility-Trend-Prediction
WSU 2020 fall Machine Learning project

1. Motivation

  In the past year, a huge pandemic was going on and restrict our original life - COVID. The solution to this is to fully have the problem handled and fully controlled. However, even with the release of vaccines like Moderna and Phizer COVID pandemice did not seem to stop or mitigate. We discuss and reveal a potential problem that could lead to this result - Mobility trend after initiation of COVID. Where mobility trend can discover potential spread path and can further control using the observation on the mobility data.
  
2. Why?

 At this very moment, even a simple project can help. Aside from that, we had this hypothesis that if build perfectly. This application can be utilize when encounter similar issue in the future, thought we did not fully developed the application. Additionally, this kind of ideas is also a great real-world problem where we can apply our machine learning knowledge and implement it.
 
3. Problem solved?

  Predicting future mobility trend. By applying machine learning model on the "Apple mobility trend dataset", this application is able to predict short-term mobility trend under the situation on pandemic. Also, by visulaized the dataset, user can easily observe what was going on the past year and how they can make changes to the decision of transportation.
  
4. Things learned?

  Machine learning(ML) model can be varied, and different kind of dataset has its own best fit ML model. We've test on several iconic ML model before finalize our decision. Sums up with, sequential ML model such as the seq2seq and the fourier regression model. Which indeed works out perfet along the "Apple mobility trend" dataset since this is considered a time sequential dataset.
  
5. Install/ Execute

  Under the directory of your choice(where you save our MLproject.py), run python3 on terminal to initiate and execute ./MLproject.py to start the application. Choice two, you can simply look up our visualized data below "MLproject.py" for a quicker access to the mobility trend.
